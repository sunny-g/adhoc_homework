There are 4 programming problems here. The README in each directory should give
you all the information you need to go on. If you submit your answers to us, be
sure to have attempted all 4 problems.

We're on the honor system here: don't get help from or give help to another
person or a resource on the internet. Do the work yourself. (It's okay if you
need to consult language docs or the MDN or similar.)

For questions, clarifications, or help with the assignments, email homework@adhocteam.us
or join our public Slack channel https://adhocteam-public.herokuapp.com/
